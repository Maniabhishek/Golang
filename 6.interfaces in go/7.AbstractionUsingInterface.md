* Interfaces are tools to define sets of actions and behaviors. They help objects to rely on abstractions and not on concrete implementations of other objects. We can compose different behaviors by grouping multiple interfaces.

### What is interface
> * An interface is a set of methods that represent common behavior for different data types.
> * interfaces allows us to organize different group of methods that applys to different types of objects ,by doing this our program can rely on higher abstractions (interfaces) as opposed to concrete implementations, allowing other methods to work with a variety of different objects that implement the same interface. this concept is called as dependency inversion
> * In Go, it’s considered best practice to build small interfaces and then compose them together to add more functionality to your objects. This way you can keep your code clean and increase reusability.
> * We can define interfaces considering the different actions that are common between multiple types.
> * In Go, we can automatically infer that a struct (object) implements an interface when it implements all its methods.

### Lets understand with a simple example

```go
	type Vehicle interface {
		drive()
	}
```
* we just defined an interface called Greeter with a method inside called greet() , interface only defines behaviors, they do not define concrete implementations. That’s the job of the object that implements this interface.
* lets create few objects which will implement Greeter interface

```go
type Car struct {
	name   string
	wheels int
}

type Bike struct {
	name   string
	wheels int
}

func (c *Car) drive() {
	fmt.Printf("driving %s which has %d wheels", c.name, c.wheels)
}

func (b *Bike) drive() {
	fmt.Printf("driving %s which has %d wheels", b.name, b.wheels)
}

```

* in the above code we declared two struct types , then we used receiver function to define the drive method on each struct type with their custom implementation.
* After this, we can say that both structs are implementing the vehicle interface
* And by doing this we can write more code that will rely on the abstraction and not in the concrete object, allowing our code to be reused. Let’s say that we want to write a new method that will print the details of these two structs. We can do that using this interface:

```go
func Process(obj Vehicle) {
	obj.drive()
}
```
* This function takes as an argument any object that implements this interface. So as long as the object responds to the methods defined inside the interface, we can use this function to process the object.
* In the main function, we can write the following to print the details of each object

```go
func main() {
	rangeRover := Car{
		name:   "range rover",
		wheels: 4,
	}

	harleyDavidson := Bike{
		name:   "Harley davidson",
		wheels: 2,
	}

	// truck := Truck{
	// 	name:   "toyota truck",
	// 	wheels: 4,
	// }

	Process(&rangeRover)
	Process(&harleyDavidson)
	// Process(&truck)  we cant do this as Truck doesn't implement this

}
```

* let's see some more example
* In this example, we’re going to process client orders. Our program will support National and International orders and both will depend on the abstraction of an interface to define the expected behavior.
* let's create a new package in go called order we will create some files 

### order.go
```go 
package order

import (
	"fmt"
)

// New ProcessOrder
func New() {
	fmt.Println("Order package!!")
	natOrd := NewNationalOrder()
	intOrd := NewInternationalOrder()
	ords := []Operations{natOrd, intOrd}
	ProcessOrder(ords)
}

// Product struct
type Product struct {
	name  string
	price int
}

// ProductDetail struct
type ProductDetail struct {
	Product
	amount int
	total  float32
}

// Summary struct
type Summary struct {
	total          float32
	subtotal       float32
	totalBeforeTax float32
}

// ShippingAddress struct
type ShippingAddress struct {
	street  string
	city    string
	country string
	cp      string
}

// Client struct
type Client struct {
	name     string
	lastName string
	email    string
	phone    string
}

// Order struct
type Order struct {
	products []*ProductDetail
	Summary
	ShippingAddress
	Client
}

// Processer interface
type Processer interface {
	FillOrderSummary()
}

// Printer interface
type Printer interface {
	PrintOrderDetails()
}

// Notifier interface
type Notifier interface {
	Notify()
}

// Operations interface
type Operations interface {
	Processer
	Printer
	Notifier
}

// ProcessOrder function
func ProcessOrder(orders []Operations) {
	for _, order := range orders {
		order.FillOrderSummary()
		order.Notify()
		order.PrintOrderDetails()
	}
} 
``` 

* Let’s walk through this file explaining each function, interface, and struct object defined.

* First, we have a New function. As you already know, we’re using uppercase for the function name because we want to export and make it available to other packages. The purpose of this first function is to create a new instance of a national order and another one for an international one. Then, we pass these two instances to the ProcessOrder function inside a slice of type Operations. We will discuss this Operation type in more detail shortly.

* The following struct types represent the various objects that we need to create an order: Product, ProductDetail, Summary, ShippingAddress, Client, and Order.

* The Order struct type will have a summary, shipping address, and client properties. It also has a products array of type ProductDetail.

* We also declared three small interfaces: Processer, Printer, and Notifier. Each of these interfaces has one function that defines the behavior other objects have to adopt to implement them.

* We have another interface called Operations. We’re composing different interfaces to create this one, which is pretty handy because it allows our program to compose objects and make the code more reusable.

* Finally, for this file, we have a ProcessOrder function which receives an array of orders. Here’s the interesting part. As opposed to receiving an array of a specific objects, this function receives an abstraction of these objects. So, as long as the objects that we pass inside the array implement the Operations interface, this function will work correctly. This is where interfaces are really useful, because they allow our program to depend on abstractions and not on concrete implementations.

* now lets implement another file called internationOrder.go
```go
package order

import (
	"fmt"
)

// international struct
var international = &InternationalOrder{}

// InternationalOrder struct
type InternationalOrder struct {
	Order
}

// NewInternationalOrder function
func NewInternationalOrder() *InternationalOrder {
	international.products = append(international.products, GetProductDetail("Lap Top", 450, 1, 450.50))
	international.products = append(international.products, GetProductDetail("Video Game", 600, 2, 1200.50))
	international.Client = SetClient("Carl", "Smith", "carlsmith@gmail.com", "9658521365")
	international.ShippingAddress = SetShippingAddress("Colfax Avenue", "Seattle", "USA", "45712")
	return international
}

// FillOrderSummary function
func (into *InternationalOrder) FillOrderSummary() {
	var extraFee float32 = 0.5
	var taxes float32 = 0.25
	var shippingCost float32 = 35
	subtotal = CalculateSubTotal(into.products)

	totalBeforeTax = (subtotal + shippingCost)
	totalTaxes = (taxes * subtotal)
	totalExtraFee = (totalTaxes * extraFee)
	total = (subtotal + totalTaxes) + totalExtraFee
	into.Summary = Summary{
		total:          total,
		subtotal:       subtotal,
		totalBeforeTax: totalBeforeTax,
	}

}

// Notify function
func (into *InternationalOrder) Notify() {
	email := into.Client.email
	name := into.Client.name
	phone := into.Client.phone

	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("---International Order---")
	fmt.Println("Notifying: ", name)
	fmt.Println("Sending email notification to :", email)
	fmt.Println("Sending sms notification to :", phone)
	fmt.Println("Sending whatsapp notification to :", phone)
}

// PrintOrderDetails function
func (into *InternationalOrder) PrintOrderDetails() {
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("International Summary")
	fmt.Println("Order details: ")
	fmt.Println("-- Total Before Taxes: ", into.Summary.totalBeforeTax)
	fmt.Println("-- SubTotal: ", into.Summary.subtotal)
	fmt.Println("-- Total: ", into.Summary.total)
	fmt.Printf("-- Delivery Address to: %s %s %s \n", into.ShippingAddress.street, into.ShippingAddress.city, into.ShippingAddress.country)
	fmt.Printf("-- Client: %s %s \n", into.Client.name, into.Client.lastName)
}
```

* This file is the first concrete implementation of the Operations interface. First, we created a new struct type called InternationalOrder, using the Order struct to define its properties and objects. Then we have an initializer function called NewInternationalOrder that will set some products for this order, the client information, and the shipping address.

* We’ll be using a helper function to initialize a new ProductDetail, Client, and ShippingAddress — don’t worry, we’ll implement this soon.

* In the rest of the file, we declare the concrete implementation for the FillOrderSummary, Notify, and PrintOrderDetails functions. With this we can say that the international order struct type implements the Operations interface because it has definitions for all its methods. Pretty cool!

* Let’s take a look at the implementation of the nationalOrder.go file:
```go
package order

import (
	"fmt"
)

// national Instance
var national = &NationalOrder{}

// NationalOrder struct
type NationalOrder struct {
	Order
}

// NewNationalOrder function
func NewNationalOrder() *NationalOrder {
	national.products = append(national.products, GetProductDetail("Sugar", 12, 3, 36))
	national.products = append(national.products, GetProductDetail("Cereal", 16, 2, 36))
	national.Client = SetClient("Phill", "Heat", "phill@gmail.com", "8415748569")
	national.ShippingAddress = SetShippingAddress("North Ave", "San Antonio", "USA", "854789")
	return national
}

// FillOrderSummary function
func (nato *NationalOrder) FillOrderSummary() {
	var taxes float32 = 0.20
	var shippingCost float32 = 5
	subtotal = CalculateSubTotal(nato.products)

	totalBeforeTax = (subtotal + shippingCost)
	totalTaxes = (taxes * subtotal)
	total = (subtotal + totalTaxes)

	nato.Summary = Summary{
		total,
		subtotal,
		totalBeforeTax,
	}
}

// Notify function
func (nato *NationalOrder) Notify() {
	email := nato.Client.email
	fmt.Println("---National Order---")
	fmt.Println("Sending email notification to:", email)
}

// PrintOrderDetails function
func (nato *NationalOrder) PrintOrderDetails() {
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("National Summary")
	fmt.Println("Order details: ")
	fmt.Println("Total: ", nato.Summary.total)
	fmt.Printf("Delivery Address to: %s %s %s \n", nato.ShippingAddress.street, nato.ShippingAddress.city, nato.ShippingAddress.country)
}
```

* This file represents the second concrete implementation of the Operations interface. Here, we have a NationalOrder struct type that also uses the Order struct type.

* We also declare an initializer function that will set some products, the client information, as well as the shipping address for this particular national order.

* Then as we did in the previous file, we have definitions for all methods we need to implement the interface. With this, the national order struct is also implementing the Operations interface because it responds to all its methods.

* With these two concrete implementations in place, we can pass any of these instances to any methods that rely on the Operations interface.

* To complete this example we just need to implement the helper functions inside the helpers.go file:

```go
package order

var (
	subtotal       float32
	total          float32
	totalBeforeTax float32
	totalTaxes     float32
	totalExtraFee  float32
)

// GetProductDetail function that takes as arguments the necessary fields
// to create a new ProductDetail struct and returns it.
func GetProductDetail(name string, price, amount int, total float32) (pd *ProductDetail) {
	pd = &ProductDetail{
		amount: amount,
		total:  total,
		Product: Product{
			name:  name,
			price: price,
		},
	}
	return
}

// SetClient function that takes as arguments the necessary fields
// to create a new Client struct and returns it.
func SetClient(name, lastName, email, phone string) (cl Client) {
	cl = Client{
		name:     name,
		lastName: lastName,
		email:    email,
		phone:    phone,
	}
	return
}

// SetShippingAddress function that takes as arguments the necessary fields
// to create a new ShippingAddress struct and returns it.
func SetShippingAddress(street, city, country, cp string) (spa ShippingAddress) {
	spa = ShippingAddress{
		street,
		city,
		country,
		cp,
	}
	return
}

// CalculateSubTotal function
func CalculateSubTotal(products []*ProductDetail) (subtotal float32) {
	for _, v := range products {
		subtotal += v.total
	}
	return
}
```

* lets implement the final main.go file

```go
package main

import (
	"interfaces/order"
)

func main() {
	order.New()
}
```
