> - why closing the channel is important when we are reading the same channel continuously, closing the channel is control signal on the channel indicating that there will be no morre flow of data
> - you will see in the below code that it will throw error , all goroutines are asleep - deadlock its because when i value is 1000 and for loop break then again main go routine tries to read the channel but there is no data sent to the channel to read thus we will get this error hence it is important to close it

> - lets see how we print numbers after every seconds, below method is without concurrency and how can we improve it  
> - below method will print numbers after every second and it will take 1000 seconds to complete it 
```go
func doSomething(i int) int {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	return rand.Intn(10)
}

// this below method will take so long to execute , we can do the same thing in much faster way
func ConcurrencyExampleWithoutConcurrency() {
	dataChan := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
			val := doSomething(i)
			dataChan <- val
		}
		close(dataChan)
	}()

	for data := range dataChan {
		fmt.Printf("%d ", data)
	}
}
```

> - let solve the above problem using concurrency
```go
func ConcurrencyExample() {
	dataChan := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
		defer close(dataChan)

		for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
			wg.Add(1)
			go func(i int) {
				defer wg.Done()
				val := doSomething(i)
				dataChan <- val
			}(i)
		}
		wg.Wait()
	}()

	for data := range dataChan {
		fmt.Printf("%d ", data)
	}
}

```
### multiple goroutine with waitgroup
```go
func CallMultipleGoRoutineWithWaitgroup() {
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(2)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		fmt.Printf("%s \n", "hello go routine 1 ")
	}()

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		fmt.Printf("%s \n", "hello go routine 2")
	}()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("end")
}
```
