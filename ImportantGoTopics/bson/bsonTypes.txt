# Package bson is a library for reading, writing, and manipulating BSON.
# BSON is a binary serialization format used to store documents and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB.

# Raw BSON
The Raw family of types is used to validate and retrieve elements from a slice of bytes. 
This type is most useful when you want do lookups on BSON bytes without unmarshaling it into another type.

# Native GO Types
The D and M types defined in this package can be used to build representations of BSON using native Go types.
D is a slice and M is a map.
